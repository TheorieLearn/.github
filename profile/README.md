# TheorieLearn

We are a team developing resources on the PrairieLearn platform to support the teaching of algorithms, data structures, and other theoretical aspects of computer science, at several different levels of the computer science curriculum at the University of Illinois.  This development effort started with [CS 374](https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/cs374al1/sp2023/)(Algorithms and Models of Computation), but has since expanded to include several other classes at Illinois, including [CS 173](https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/193/sp2023/) (Discrete Structures), [CS 277](https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/cs277/sp2023/) (Algorithms and Data Structures for [Data Science](https://datascience.illinois.edu/)), and [CS 401](https://cs.illinois.edu/academics/courses/cs401)/[403](https://cs.illinois.edu/academics/courses/cs403) (Accelerated Fundamentals of Algorithms).

All of our code is currently hosted at [https://github.com/jeffgerickson/pl-uiuc-cs374], but we expect to partition our code into smaller repositories and move them under this organization as soon as PrairieLearn supports stable question sharing.

See [https://theorielearn.github.io/] for more information about the project,.

Feel free to contact the project director [Jeff Erickson](https://jeffe.cs.illinois.edu) with any questions.
